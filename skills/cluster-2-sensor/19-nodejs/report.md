Author: Ayush Upneja, 2019-10-08

## Summary

I installed node.js and npm. I completed the hello world tutorial and every module. Every module has a relevant .js and/or html file(s) and also a picture of terminal and actually running. For the sensor portion I recorded a video of it working which can be seen below.
