#  Skill 11 - Servo

Author: Ayush Upneja, 2019-09-17

## Summary

I set up the servo to rotate 180 degrees as opposed to the 90 degrees in the example. I tinkered with the minimum and maximum pulsewidth (min: 450, max: 2450) to adjust for inconsistencies. The relevant code file is servo.c in the code folder. Below is a video of the servo in action!
