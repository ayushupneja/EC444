#  RTOS Hardware Interrupt Skill 12

Author: Ayush Upneja, 2019-09-20

## Summary

I was able to get the button to change from up to down on the I2c display, and also get the leds to count up and down based on whether the button was pressed. The wiring was done properly on the board and the relevant c file is in the code folder labelled rtos.c. Below is a video of it in action!
