# Skill 26 Vibration

Author: Ayush Upneja, 2019-10-18

## Summary

I wired up the vibration switch, and programmed the hardware interrupt to light up the LED #13 when it was tapped. I took away the debouncing so that the tap was only counted once and prints the tap on the console. The relevant C file is in the code folder labelled vibration.c and a video depicting the process is linked below.
