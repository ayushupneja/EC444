## Summary

I downloaded the WiFi station example and changeed the code to reflect the SSID and passwoord. I successfully built and flashed the file, and the ESP32 was assigned under 192.168.1.100. In the router admin page, I can see that the ESP32 is on the network. Below are the screenshots of the terminal and the admin page.
