#  Skill 28 PWMLED

Author: Ayush Upneja, 2019-10-17

## Summary


I designed a console control program to set intensity level from 0 to 9. It used a PWM cycle for this. I also implemented a program cycle which drove the LED in steps from 0-9 staying in each one for 250ms. The relevant c files for both parts are in the code folder and a video depicting the process is linked below.
